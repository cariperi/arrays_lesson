## How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
I generally feel confident with the content we've learned on Arrays so far. I grasp what an array is as a Ruby object, how to identify elements by their index value, and some basic methods. It's helpful for me to think about pop and push (and shift and unshift) as opposite pairs, and to think about pop and shift as "removing" methods and push and unshift as "adding" methods.

## Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
I don't feel that there is any additional learning I need to do before moving on. Excited to learn more about how to work with and manipulate Arrays!

## What questions do you have about Arrays?
One question I have about Arrays is how to work with sub-arrays, and when this would be appropriate in real-life applications (and is there a limit to how many nested levels an Array can have?).
